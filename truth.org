* jar
** tag
    - A jar's tag is set only on mark.
    - An urn's ink times that urn's jar's tag is that urn's SDR valuation.
** zzz
    - A jar's zzz is set only on mark.
    - When the era exceeds an ilk's lax plus that ilk's jar's zzz,
      that ilk's urns can be bit.
    - When the era exceeds an ilk's jar's zzz,
      that ilk's urns cannot free or draw.
* ilk
** axe
    - An ilk's initial axe is 1.
    - An ilk's axe is set only on chop.
    - When an urn is bit, its art is multiplied by its ilk's axe.
** hat
    - An ilk's initial hat is 0.
    - An ilk's hat is set only on cork.
    - When an ilk's din exceeds its hat, that ilk's urns cannot draw.
** lax
    - An ilk's initial lax is 0.
    - An ilk's lax is set only on calm.
** mat
    - An ilk's initial mat is 1.
    - An ilk's mat is set only on cuff.
    - The factors of an urn's minimum SDR valuation are:
         a. the urn's art;
         b. the urn's ilk's chi;
         c. the par; and
         d. the mat.
    - When an urn's SDR valuation is below the urn's minimum SDR valuation,
      that urn cannot free or draw.
** tax
    - An ilk's initial tax is 1.
    - An ilk's tax is set only on crop.
    - An ilk's chi is multiplied by that ilk's tax every second.
** chi
    - An ilk's initial chi is 1.
    - Every second, for each ilk with positive rum,
      dai is created according to that ilk's rum times that ilk's chi
      and used for flap.
    - Dai created in that way is accounted for by increased lad debt.
